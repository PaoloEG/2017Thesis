My Thesis's Project

Abstract:

What if you could know the study hall's occupancy before leaving your house? What if, during a hard study period, you could know what classrooms are completely free? It would be useful and could sometimes saves you some precious time, right? The main goal of this thesis project is to develop a low-cost occupancy sensor, that can estimate the number of people in classrooms, laboratories, study halls and other environments frequented by the students of Politecnico di Milano. The estimation is carried out through the Wi-Fi probes detection and count. These probes are particular types of Wi-Fi packets, which contain the unique identi cation number of the sender devices. Along with the occupancy estimation, the sensor provides also environmental data like temperature, humidity, pressure and brightness. All the data collected are uploaded to a public website, to make them easy to reach by students. Along with the typical website method, a chat-bot is implemented, in order to make the data consulting quicker by students using smartphones, without loading the entire website. We think that this last solution will be more appreciated by those students who frequently use messaging apps, rather than websites, to retrieve informations. We achieved promising results, that makes us better comprehend the potentiality of this non intrusive Wi-Fi count method. If combined with environmental data, we believe that this technique can lead to further steps, in order to achieve the higher goal of a smart campus development.
